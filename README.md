# Odin Libpcap!
----

General bindings for using the libpcap library on Linux, Mac and theoretically NPcap on Windows (untested)

**TL;DR** 
Most of the basic functionality of the pcap.odin file has been tested, it can open, read, and process pcap files / streams from interfaces.
As you get into more specific filtering or niche macro checks, I've not quite converted everything across, open to help! <3
